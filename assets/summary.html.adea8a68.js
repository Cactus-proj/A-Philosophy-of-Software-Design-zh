The presence of any of these symptoms in a system suggests that there is a problem with the system\u2019s design:</p><ul><li>Shallow Module: the interface for a class or method isn\u2019t much simpler than its implementation (see pp. 25, 110).</li><li>Information Leakage: a design decision is reflected in multiple modules (see p. 31).</li><li>Temporal Decomposition: the code structure is based on the order in which operations are executed, not on information hiding (see p. 32).</li><li>Overexposure: An API forces callers to be aware of rarely used features in order to use commonly used features (see p. 36).</li><li>Pass-Through Method: a method does almost nothing except pass its arguments to another method with a similar signature (see p. 46).</li><li>Repetition: a nontrivial piece of code is repeated over and over (see p. 62).</li><li>Special-General Mixture: special-purpose code is not cleanly separated from general purpose code (see p. 65).</li><li>Conjoined Methods: two methods have so many dependencies that its hard to understand the implementation of one without understanding the implementation of the other (see p. 72).</li><li>Comment Repeats Code: all of the information in a comment is immediately obvious from the code next to the comment (see p. 104).</li><li>Implementation Documentation Contaminates Interface: an interface comment describes implementation details not needed by users of the thing being documented (see p. 114).</li><li>Vague Name: the name of a variable or method is so imprecise that it doesn\u2019t convey much useful information (see p. 123).</li><li>Hard to Pick Name: it is difficult to come up with a precise and intuitive name for an entity (see p. 125).</li><li>Hard to Describe: in order to be complete, the documentation for a variable or method must be long. (see p. 131).</li><li>Nonobvious Code: the behavior or meaning of a piece of code cannot be understood easily. (see p. 148).</li></ul><hr><h2 id="about-the-author" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-author" aria-hidden="true">#</a> About the Author</h2><p>John Ousterhout is the Bosack Lerner Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University.
